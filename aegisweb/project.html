	<h1>Our Project</h1>
	<div class="center">
	<p>This project is for the Professional Development unit of our Computer Forensics and Security course. </p>
	<p>We were given a short brief at the beginning of the project, and have had to produce a product that meets the requirements of the brief. </p>
	<p>For this project, you will need to write a program someone could run to check an Active Directory (or similar) to assess if network users have any weak passwords (e.g. duplicates, weak, admin, etc). KnowBe4 in the US do a similar tool (https://www.knowbe4.com/weak-password-test).
The program should also run a check on the users to check if anyone has an account that has been compromised in a data breach using the https://haveibeenpwned.com/ service. </p>
	<p>However, decided to push these requirements much further and these are the features we've produced: </p>
	<p>•	Analyses account passwords in an active directory using a low-budget password strength estimation algorithm</p>
	<p>•	Uses the HaveIBeenPwned API to check both emails and passwords to display database breaches they were included in.</p>
	<p>•	Customizable reporting including text output, email output and a wordcloud of frequently used passwords</p>
	<p>•	Supports both automatic and manual extraction of password data from a Windows Server</p>
	<p>•	Password statistic reporting, displaying worst passwords, password length distributions and how many meet strength requirements</p>
	<p>•	Passwords should never be visible to any external service</p>
